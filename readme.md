## Bookmarklets

### 960ify

A quick bookmarklet for making fluid-width webpages 960px wide for readability.
Useful for MSDN and other documentation sites, especially where tables are used which Instapaper can't deal with.

### Meta Snooper

Quickly grabs important meta content from the current page, including;

* Open Graph tags
* Description
* Keywords

_*Note*: Requires a browser which has `document.querySelectorAll`._

### Viewport Breakers

Bookmarklet to detect elements which force the page outside the viewport.
